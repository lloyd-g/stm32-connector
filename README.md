# stm32-connector
a project to use libopemcm3 to colect data via usb-cdc class or serial 

my development is using a STM3210B-EVAL because I have one left over from something else.

http://www.mouser.co.uk/STM3210B/
could use a MAPLE?

as I can't work out submodues have to 

git clone https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3.git

into/libopencm3

Did think of bare metal serial like

but it was limited as I could not find any good examples for SPI and I2C.
